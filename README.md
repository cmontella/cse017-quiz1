# Quiz 1

The only thing you need to do for this quiz is add a link to Main.java that prints your name to the console. The boilerplate is there, you just need to add one line. But you need to do this over git, so the real purpose of this quiz is to demonstrate the ability to use Github to edit code. You can do this assignment 1 of two ways:

1. Clone the repository to your personal computer using the git program. You can do this either through the console or the VS Code gui interface.
2. Use Github's web-based editor.
